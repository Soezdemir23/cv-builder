# CV-Builder 
A CV-Builder is a nifty way to create automated curriculum vitae.
## Version 1 is out!
Working Form!
Working Imagepicker working!
Converting into PDF is working!

## What's next, when I come back?
+ Add another layout or two to the mix so it utilizes the full brunt of the form.
  + Harvard CV
  + One of these CVs that display level stats and are colorful, without the non-descriptive scale.
+ Rewrite the CSS in Tailwind CSS
+ Better Layout
+ Dropdown Menu for choosing Layouts
+ Clean up code that was becoming redundant with the complete refactor

## What was the most difficult part of creating this project?

When I worked on this, the most difficult part wasn't forgetting to incorporate more States to handle the re-rendering.
It was working with nested Objects and make sure how to handle adding, modifying the content.
It got so bad that I started to create a new project,
simply to isolate the forms from each other and inspect or debug them.
Focusing on one Component at a time helped me solve the problem in a few weeks,
Transferring the problem's solution, or solving it again on the main project took then
no longer than an hour max, following a few bug fixes through further development.
